# Detection-of-MCI-from-MRI-using-Gradient-Boosting-Classifier
This work is used to detetect MCI(Mild congintive impairment).

This work presents a non-invasive approach for detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). 
Images are pre-processed using 2D Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transforms and classified using to the 
Gradient Boosting classifier. An accuracy of 97.25% was obtained for classifying Cognitive Normal (CN) and 
MCI subjects
